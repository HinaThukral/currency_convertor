# currency_convertor
There are two files in this project:
App.js-
I used api from fixer.io to get the current currency rates for different countries.
Then,I take two values from user
one is that user wants to convert from which country and the other is
to convert in that country
Then I use fetch keyword to pass the url and base
I just use currency for 1st country as a base
Then I get the today's rate for the country we want to convert in
I just multiply the amount user enter and the today's rate
